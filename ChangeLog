V0.1.2
---------

Fixed version numbering

V0.1.1
---------

* Symbol properties (line colors and width) now apply to the menu button

V0.1
---------
 * First version of the fork (arguably more minimalistic and informative behavior):
   - non-gray colors do not change.
   - active window: show symbol on hovering.
   - inactive window: always show symbol, show ring color on hovering.
   - application menu button is considered special and stays as in vanilla breeze.
   - no more option for non macOS-like buttons as it doesn't apply anymore.

V5.14
---------
 * Upgraded for Breeze 5.14 with its new shadows.
 * Applied the upstream patch https://phabricator.kde.org/D16596.

V5.13
---------
 * First version, made out of Breeze 5.13 and BreezeBlurred with new options.
 * Set the font style name for KDE to render it correctly. I don't know why KDE needs that while LXQt doesn't.
 * Added an option for not using macOS-like buttons.
 * Added flatness to the exception list.
 * Made inactive macOS-like buttons gray.
 * Added a setting for button spacing.
 * Added opacity override to the exception dialog.
