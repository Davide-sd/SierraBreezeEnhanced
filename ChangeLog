V0.3
---------

* added option to display small shadows for inactive windows as a way to make the active window more salient wrt others (issue #4).
* ported Match Title Bar Color from Sierra Breeze. It matches the "BackgroundNormal" color under "Windows" section of the color scheme. Title Bar Text Color is manipulated to guarantee visibility (issue #5).
* ported Font Weight Combobox from Breeze Enhanced.
* other minor fixes and code clean-up.

V0.2
---------

* Added settings option for decoration style:
  - distinct decoration for active and inactive windows (default).
  - use the active decoration also for inactive windows.
  - use the inactive decoration also for the active window.

V0.1.2
---------

* Fixed version numbering.

V0.1.1
---------

* Symbol properties (line colors and width) now apply to the menu button.

V0.1
---------
 * First version of the fork (arguably more minimalistic and informative behavior):
  - non-gray colors do not change.
  - active window: show symbol on hovering.
  - inactive window: always show symbol, show ring color on hovering.
  - application menu button is considered special and stays as in vanilla breeze.
  - no more option for non macOS-like buttons as it doesn't apply anymore.
